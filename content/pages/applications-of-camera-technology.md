title: Applications of Camera Technology
uid: be7b0d4e-8aa5-fbd3-d810-23d3381d5f65
---

Overview
--------

Throughout the workshop, students explored real applications of camera technology by listening to keynote speakers in space, maritime salvage, and bio-engineering industries. In order continue their education on this topic and engineering in general after the workshop, speakers from the Society of Women Engineers and Women Technology Program at MIT talked about future opportunities. In addition, students participated in hands-on demos with 3-d scanning, photogrammetry, and light ﬁeld cameras.

Workshop Goals
--------------

*   Discover what engineering is and how it is applied to camera technology
*   Challenge stereotypes of who engineers are and what they do

"What Cameras Can Do For You; and How They Do It!"

Demos
-----

At the end of the workshop, the girls rotated through hands-on camera demonstrations such as light ﬁeld cameras, 3-d scanning, and photogrammetry.
